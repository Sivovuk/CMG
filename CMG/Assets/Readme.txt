I didn't use the premade or download assets or scripts in this test project.
Only 2 packages are TMPro for UI text and LeanTween for animations because it's optimized for UI elements.

Both builds work, only for Android I have added the user keystore a debug version so you can use them. The PASSWORD is viktor97.
Here's the link for the builds : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WElV4WP3YSk2YuE_OFy0H3O9RnWs4Y-c?usp=sharing

Hope you enjoy.
